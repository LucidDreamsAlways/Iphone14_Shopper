# Iphone14_Shopper
 Searches websites and shows the lowest price for the iphone of your choice using UiPath Studio.

Using UIPath Studio, the application will automate the scrapping iPhone prices from well-known e-commerce sites like Amazon, Shopee, and Expansys. Choosing the iPhone model they want to buy is how the user starts the process. When the product's name and price have been located, the application will search all the given websites for it, get it, and save the results in a CSV file. In order to compare costs and locate the best offer without having to visit many websites, the prices will be arranged in ascending order and a copy of the CSV will be sent to the user through email. In order to locate the greatest bargain for the iPhone model they want, the user can utilize this app to save time and effort.
